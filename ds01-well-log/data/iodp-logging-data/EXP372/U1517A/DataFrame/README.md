This file goes over the data collected in IODP Expedition 372 Borehole U1517A.
Independent Variable: DEPTH_LSF
Dependent variables: UCAVm GR_RAB, GRMA, RHON, BPHI, TNPH, RES_BD, A40B, P16B, VCO, VSH

UCAV: actual width of the borehole
GR_RAB and GRMA: Gamma Ray resistivity. How non-radioactive something is.
RHON: Density
BPHI: Best porosity, , measured by the amount of void space
TNHP: Porosity, measures the amount of water in a formation
RES_BD, A40B, P16B: Electrical resistivity measured at different horizontal depths into the formation.
VCO: Velocity of compressional waves (p-waves)
VSH: Velocity  of shear waves (s-waves)

Data can be found in cleaned_data.csv. VCO and VSH columns have been cleaned to remove -999s.
